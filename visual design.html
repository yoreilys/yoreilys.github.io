<h1>Visual design class</h1>

<h2> coustom potato heads</h2>
<img src="strawberry.png" width="250" height="250" alt=""/>	
	<h3> While creating this project I first researched for the photos I needed being the eyes, lips, nose, ears, jewelry, and from then I put them all together to create my potato monster.</h3>
	
	<h2> artifact #2</h2>
<h2>picasso faces </h2>
<img src="picasso faces.png" width="250" height="250" alt=""/>
	<h3> To make this project I looked up different celebrities such as phoebe tonkin for the base, zendaya for the nose, and claire holt for the eyes. i don't necessarily think this portrait looks like me, i say this because besides the nose none of the features are identical or as similar to mine.</h3>
	
	<h2> artifact #3</h2>
<h2> pop art gradients</h2>
<img src="popart.png" width="350" height="250" alt=""/>
	<h3> I chose the gradient portrait, I chose this one because out of all the options I believe it's the best one I've made. I chose to use phoebe tonkin and claire holt because they are both my two favorite celebrities that have been my favorite for years on end. I chose different variations of purple because it's my favorite color and I thought it would match nicely with the photo I had chosen. I began by following the instructions of finding a photo i like, then choosing a color then changing its size and duplicating them until I left with four identical photos. After being left with these photos I placed them each on a side of the portrait and then changed the color of three of the photos.</h3>
	
	<h2> artifact #4</h2>
<h2> using clipping mask</h2>
<img src="my name.png" width="250" height="250" alt=""/>
